<p>  <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Energy-Environment/Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Stations-in-New-York/7rrd-248n">An analysis of data</a> from The United States Department of Energy shows that electric vehicle charging stations are most popular in the boroughs of New York City, around Long Island and in the Catskill Albany region of New York State. The data I analyzed was collected starting March 28, 2016 until December 12, 2021. In the 2021-2022 Legislative Session of the New York State Senate, Democratic Senator Peter Harckham of the 40th Senate District <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/s2758 ">brought forth a bill</a> that would make all passenger vehicles electric by the year 2035. <a href="https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2021/S2758">The bill</a> was signed into law by Governor Kathy Hochul on Sept. 8, 2021. 

<p> Electric vehicles are serving as a more of an environmentally-friendly alternative to gasoline-driven vehicles, due to a variety of factors such as; energy costs, which are said to be lower than conventional vehicles, infrastructure availability, which equates to a benefit for charging with ease, and less harmful emissions <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_benefits.html">according to the</a> Alternative Fuels Data Center of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Department. The AFDC also has a <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/calc/"> vehicle cost calculator </a> which allows a consumer to calculate fuel usage for a particular make and model of vehicles, including alternative fuel types as well. </p>


<p> On Aug. 5, 2021, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/">President Biden</a> announced his plans for clean energy as it pertains to vehicles such as cars and trucks, where he signed an Executive Order mandating that all vehicles sold by the year 2030 are environmentally friendly vehicles, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-executive-order-raises-the-bar-on-9285987/">such as</a> zero-emission vehicles, which include battery electric, plug-in hybrid and fuel cell electric vehicles. 


<p>The White House Press Briefing Room <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-electric-vehicle-charging-action-plan/">recently put out a statement on Dec. 13, 2021</a> regarding electric vehicles in the United States by Vice President Kamala Harris. The newly Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Biden's Build Back Better Agenda plan to invest in infrastructure, manufacturing and incentives to help with increasing the priority of electric vehicle usage, among other areas. President Biden has declared that the future of vehicles in the country are electric.

<p>
   According to my analysis of my data, I found that Saratoga Springs, specifically the zip code, 12866, has the highest number of electric vehicle charging stations across New York State, which is 68. </p>

   <p> The second highest number of electric vehicle charging stations which represent a zip code are tied in the same region of New York State, 12065 and 12205. The zip code 12065 represents Half Moon, NY at 1 electric vehicle charging station and Clifton Park, NY, at 39 electric vehicle charging stations. The zip code 12205 encompasses the city of Albany and the city of Colonie, NY. Albany has 30 electric vehicle charging stations while Colonie has 10, equal to 40 charging vehicles for that particular zip code.  </p>
